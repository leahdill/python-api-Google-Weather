# python_api_challenge

In Part 1 of this two-part challenge, I was tasked to use data from OpenWeatherAPI and Google to explore the relationship between proximity to the equator and various weather conditons like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Unsurprisingly, the relationship between max temperatures and latitude remains unimpeachable. All relationships were visualized using scatterplots and further analyzed using linear regressions in the WeatherPy workbook.

Part 2 of this project required me to use all the collected and cleaned data from WeatherPy to evaluate desireable (to me) vacation spots and to find nearby hotels for such getaways. After narrrowing down my ideal weather conditions to find desirable cities, I used gmaps to pin my travel destinations worldwide.
